Hi! Christmas came early so we are already giving out presents to you every day until the end of December, check the gift image in the bottom right corner. I hope it will help a bit those who struggle with ratio and we all will enjoy them. There won't be site-wide Free Leech this year.

We are now also running donations to cover servers bills. From security reasons you can donate in cryptocurrency only, either Bitcoin via Donate button in the top right corner with automated processing, or Ethereum or Monero in which case send Staff PM to receive unique donation address for you as these donations are manually processed. You can read more about donations here.

We trully appreciate your ongoing support and wish everyone only the best. Merry Christmas!
